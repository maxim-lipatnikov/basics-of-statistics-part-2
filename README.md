# Basics of Statistics Part 2 (by Anatoly Karpov)
This repository contains my materials and an outline for part 2 of one of the most famous statistics courses in Russia by Anatoly Kaprov.

**Anatoly Karpov** is a well-known expert with experience in the top companies, whose courses (including this one) were so popular that he decided to create his own data science online school **karpov.courses**. Currently, the school offers a large number of data analytics and machine learning courses, and is a direct competitor of the largest player in online education - Yandex.

## Course Contents
1. **Analyzing nominative data:**
  - Pearson's distance, chi-square distribution and Pearson's chi-square test
  - Analysis of contingency tables
  - Fisher's exact test
2. **Logistic regression and non-parametric methods:**
  - General concept and meaning
  - Intercept-only model
  - Model with one nominative predictor
  - Model with several nominative predictors
  - Model with interaction of predictors
  - Non-parametric tests (why they are needed and when they are used) - Shapiro-Wilk, Mann-Whitney, and Kruskal-Wallis tests
3. **Cluster analysis and Principal Component Analysis:**
  - The k-means method
  - Ways of determining the optimal number of clusters
  - Hierarchical clustering (k-nearest neighbors method, full linkage method, centroid method)
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## Tech Stack
1. Python with libraries (pandas, numpy, statsmodels, sklearn, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, lifelines)
2. Jupyter Lab

## Results
The course was 100% successfully completed. During the course, I not only improved my understanding of statistical concepts and methods, but also practiced applying them using Python. At the end of the course I received a certificate, which can also be found in this repository.
